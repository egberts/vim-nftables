Applications that does highlightings of NFTABLES
------------------------------------------------

* [Vim]()  Oops, should soon be my Vim syntax files.
* [NeoVim]()  Oops, should soon be my Vim syntax files.
* [Sublime](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/Nftables)
* [Nano](https://ral-arturo.org/2016/10/17/nftables-debian-stretch.html) editor

Of course, the aboves can do simple highlightings of few words but 
no enforcement of proper syntax like `vim-nftables` does.
